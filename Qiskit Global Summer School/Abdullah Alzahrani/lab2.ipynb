    "1. There is a slight difference between the circuits constructed here and those defined in the EPLG paper. For a circuit of depth $d$ (for even $d$), we randomly sample 1q Clifford gates for $d/2$ layers, and then we invert the circuit for the last $d/2$ layers. This provides a simple implmentation for our purposes, and the details of this difference are beyond the scope of this lab.\n",
    "2. We perform 1q Clifford sampling by taking advantage of the fact that for backends whose single qubit gates are composed of $R_z(\\theta_1) \\sqrt{X} R_z(\\theta_2) \\sqrt{X} R_z(\\theta_3)$, when $\\theta_i \\in \\{ \\pm \\pi / 2, \\pm \\pi, 0 \\}$, the resulting single qubit gate is a Clifford.

    "Finally, we can construct our `EstimatorPub`s. The [`EstimatorPub`](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/qiskit/primitives/containers/estimator_pub.py#L36) is can be seen as a tuple consisting of a `QuantumCircuit`, an `ObservablesArray`, and a `BindingsArray` (and optionally a precision). Given an `EstimatorPub` with a given shape, the `EstimatorV2` will return arrays of expectation values (and their standard deviations) whose shape is the same as the input `EstimatorPub`.\n",

    "- the depth of the circuit (we have chosen `6` depths here by default).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we will have $2 \\times 6 = 12$ `EstimatorPub`s total. Within each of these, we have `10` twirling samples, and `k` fidelities (which depends on the path you chose, this should roughly be half of the length of the path). So we have $12$ `EstimatorPub`s, each with $10 k$ elements.\n",

    "Therefore, the total number of expectation values that we *expect* to receive is $120k$. For a length $30$ chain, $k = 15$, meaning we should roughly $1,800$ expectation values back overall (depending on the edges of the chain)."
